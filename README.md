# Landing-page2

This Landing Page project is part of The Odin Project. I have done this project already, but after a long break from the program, I decided to redo the big projects to refresh my understanding of HTML/CSS. In my previous attempt, I changed the written informaiton to be something that I was interested. In this attempt, I will use the provided content from TOP, and focus more on getting the landing page to match the answer provided. After I am done, I may create another, personal landing page.
